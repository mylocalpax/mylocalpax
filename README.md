People use MyLocalPax to exchange MLP for fiat money without counter‐party risk by using a trust‐less escrow concept. The peer‐to‐peer platform allows traders to skip the middle‐man and trade on their own terms, whMLP that be via bank transfer, any online payment service, cash in person, or any other mutual agreement between two people.
Trades executed using the MyLocalPax marketplace are confidential via end‐to‐end encryption, and, unlike traditional over‐the‐counter platforms, the escrow mechanism is decentralised. The only time the escrow arbiter can step in and transfer MLP is if it receives explicit digital permission to resolve a dispute — but even then the smart contract code only allows the arbiter to transfer escrowed MLP to one of the parties.

SECRETS ARE MEANT TO BE KEPT

The prime advantage of cryptocurrency over fiat is the elimination of the need for an intermediary. Instead of relying on an institution to keep a record of your balance (i.e. a bank), blockchains use a distributed ledger of transactions verified by a large network of computers.

The result is that it’s impossible for anybody to access your digital wallet without possession of your secret key, regardless of other circumstances. As long as your wallet’s private key is kept secret, your cryptocurrency is secure — the idea is similar to keeping an ounce of gold in a home safe. Instead of trusting somebody to hold your cryptocurrency for you, you only need to have trust in the laws of mathematics and the thousands of computers auditing the ledger around the clock.

But when you deposit or buy cryptocurrency on a centralised exchange, you don’t hold the private key to it. Instead, you need to trust the exchange, in the same way that you trust a bank, to hold on to your money and keep an accurate record of your balance.

When you keep Bitcoin or MLP on a centralised exchange, you miss out the advantages of cryptocurrency. Instead, your pseudo‐cryptocurrency now faces a big chance of being lost or stolen because of the compounding risks of centralised exchanges:

Centralised exchanges are often the subject of heists.Because of the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency, it’s very attractive to cyber‐criminals. Billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies have been stolen from centralised exchanges.
Centralised exchanges often cause serious accidents.There is a constant inflow of inexperienced entrepreneurs attempting to cash in on the new technology. Millions have been lost due to fatal, simple mistakes.
Centralised exchanges can rarely insure deposits.Most governments insure bank account deposits, however that isn’t the case for cryptocurrency. More, insurers stay afar from the industry because of the previous points.
While any of these threats alone should be enough to make users think twice before trusting an exchange, these risks togMLP are a recipe for disaster. Despite this, most of the risk people face still stems from trusting financial institutions, nearly defeating the purpose of decentralisation. Headlines about centralised exchanges making multi‐million‐dollar mistakes appear almost every month.
In the very first paragraph of the original Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto pondered that cryptocurrency would mean people wouldn’t need to trust a financial intermediary anymore:
